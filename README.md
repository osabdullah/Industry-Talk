# Industry-Talk 
Refliction: 
At first, I did not expect the meeting to be this arranged and this exciting. This meeting presented people who were just starting out and until recently were students just like us. We also saw how these people think and why they were specially chosen over others. I learned from this meeting to be passionate and not to give up, and that doing what I love makes me a distinct person from others, because by nature, when you love something, you will put your best effort into it.
